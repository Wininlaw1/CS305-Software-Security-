1(Q)Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client?

They want to address the issue of modernizing the operations. Using the latest software security. Helping from potential threats.

2(Q)What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 2(A) When for a company like this security is much needed. It's important to code security from the first line of code. From then on out it can be architectural decisions. Then just keep up the code to keep from data breaches. Every business security never stops being needed. Meaning at any point it can be outdated and need updated security.

3(Q)Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 3(A) Sometimes I had problems just rolling the report off just basic mistakes. But lucky most stuff was done for me to not have to do. Yet it was my first time doing anything software security.

4(Q)How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 4(A) Input validation is the way to increase layers. Never trust input from a user string or from a database. Whether doing sanitation to prevent behaviors or even worse.

5(Q)How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 5(A) By checking for errors and running it for testing. Looking at the analysis helps label every potential risk found.

6(Q)What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 6(A) Mavin-plugin is used all over the industry. Using it was needed and became quite useful.

7(Q)Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 7(A) Maybe where a checksum was implemented. That assignment was the most interesting one. Overall I wasn't a big fan of doing software security.
